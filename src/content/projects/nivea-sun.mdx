## Overview
**NIVEA SUN** is a data-driven web experience featuring 3D particle systems that adapt to real-time weather conditions. The project combines creative coding with visual storytelling to deliver a branded and engaging user interaction.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Role
**Creative Developer & Technical Designer**

---

## ‚ùì Problem
1. The experience needed to reflect real-time weather in an interactive format.
2. Assets had to be lightweight enough for mobile performance.

---

## üéØ Goal
1. Build a responsive 3D particle system synced with live weather data.
2. Offer a playground UI for real-time parameter adjustment.
3. Optimize static elements for responsive rendering.

---

## ‚ú® Solution

### Interactive Playground
- Designed an interface that exposes all particle system parameters.
- Allowed client-side customization of visuals in real-time.

### Meteorological Integration
- Fetched live data to dynamically control particle behaviors (wind, intensity, color).
- Created seasonal presets based on NIVEA‚Äôs marketing needs.

### Mobile Optimization
- Converted complex animations into APNGs for non-interactive contexts.
- Used tools like APNGasm and PNGoo to ensure compression without quality loss.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Learnings
- Integrating live weather APIs required caching strategies and fallback designs.
- Learned about balancing interactivity with accessibility and responsiveness.
- Discovered new formats (APNG) for preserving motion in light assets.

---

## ‚ú® Final Thoughts
- This project pushed the limits of front-end interactivity and performance.
- Techniques developed here will serve future projects in data visualization and branded experiences.
