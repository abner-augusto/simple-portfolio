## Overview
The **Mosteiro Guaramiranga** project utilized drone photogrammetry to capture detailed, high-resolution images for the creation of optimized 3D models. These models were specifically tailored for mobile visualization and practical use.

---

## 👨‍💻 Role
**Lead 3D Artist & Technical Specialist**

---

## ❓ Problem
1. High-resolution 3D models initially had excessive polygon counts, making them impractical for mobile visualization.
2. Need for maintaining visual quality while significantly reducing the complexity of the models.

---

## 🎯 Goal
1. Efficiently capture and generate high-quality photogrammetric models.
2. Optimize 3D models for performance on mobile devices without significant loss in detail.

## ✨ Solution

### Capture Process
- Utilized drones for capturing extensive high-resolution images from multiple angles.
- Generated detailed initial models using Agisoft Metashape.

### Optimization Techniques
- Implemented texture baking to preserve visual details with reduced geometry.
- Used triangle decimation, reducing polygon count from approximately 20 million to around 800,000.

### Final Delivery
- Published optimized models on Sketchfab for easy accessibility and interactive exploration.
- Ensured mobile-friendly visualization through rigorous testing and adjustments.
