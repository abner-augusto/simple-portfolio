## Overview
**Parque das Crian√ßas**, also known as Parque da Liberdade, is a historical public space in the heart of Fortaleza, Cear√°.

### Heritage and Sensory Design
- Restored and reimagined historical elements using techniques like **anastylosis**.
- Integrated open-air heritage education via visual storytelling and interactive symbols.
- Developed organic floor patterns and permeable paving to reinforce exploratory movement.

### Landscape and Uses
- Mixed contemplative green areas with active zones to attract diverse user profiles.
- Reprogrammed historical buildings for uses such as caf√©s, administration, bike support, and more.
